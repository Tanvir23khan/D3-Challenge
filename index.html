            and Health Risks</h2>
            <p>
              In this Data-Driven Document (D3) project, the information is collected from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System has been used to explore the relations between demographics and health risk factors. Each marker represents an individual state in the USA. Please click on axis titles to see how these variables relate to each other and hover on any of the markers to see how for more information!

          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h2>
          <p>The charts above display positive correlations between risk factors obesity and smoking in relation to poverty and household income. 
              The visible trend indicates that less affluent and poorer states have higher obesity rates and greater tendencies of smoking. 
              Wealthier states not only had higher rates of healthcare coverage, but lower obesity and smoking rates.
              The visualizations also indicate that the trends are not absolute because there are some clear outliers. 
              For example, there are states such as North Dakota and Iowa with relatively low poverty and high obesity rates.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age</h2>
          <p>The correlations between health risks and age are more convoluted. The median ages in most US states are between 
              36-40 years old. This clustered the visualizations making them more difficult to identify. However, a keen
              eye would be able to see that there are indeed some correlations, such as: higher median age and higher healthcare
              coverage, lower median age and lower smoking rates, and finally, lower median age and lower obesity rates.</p>
          <h2>Some interesting insights:</h2>
          <p>  <ul>
            <li>
              There looks to be a positive correlation between the Lacks Healthcare and In Poverty. Southern states tend to have the highest rates of poverty and less healthcare coverage (with Texas being an outlier as it has the highest % lacking healthcare) while some New England states have the lowest rates of poverty and lack of healthcare.
            </li>
            <li>
              The age demographic is squarely within the middle age range from age 30-45.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is a negative correlation between Lacks Healthcare and Household Income, so wealthier states tend to have more healthcare coverage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Smoking has a positive correlation with poverty, none with age, and a negative correlation with household income.
            </li>
            <li>
              Obesity also has a positive correlation with poverty, none with age, and a negative correlation with household income.
            </li>

            <li>
              Lower income was consistently associated with higher smoking prevalence,the states with lower median income have significantly higher smoking prevalence. Also Data visualisation shows smoking rate is higher among adults between 36-42 years old.
            </li>
            <li>
              In generall, overall obesity prevalence decreased with increased levels of income, as we see the states with higher median income and lower poverty percentage have significantly lower obesity prevalence. Among adult between 36-38 years old, the obesity prevalence is higher.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data visualisation shows overall healthcare improves with increase in median inocome, in general the states with median income above $65,000 have lower lacks healthcare. Although there is some exception, like Alaska and New Jersey
